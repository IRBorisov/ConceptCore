# üèõÔ∏è ConceptCore

C++ library for manipulating concepts in formal language of advanced set theory

## üå≤ Structure

- ccl - ConceptCoreLibrary static C++ library
- coredll - ConceptCoreDLL binary for Windows embedding
- pyconcept - Python wrapper for some core RSLanguage and parsing functions

## üì¶ Project build

Use Dockerfile to setup Clang / GCC build for Ubuntu development.
Use VS Solution for Windows development.
Use ccl/CMakeLists.txt for other platforms.

Windows development requires Bison installed and Visual Studio 2022+.
After changing grammar / syntax you can rebuild lexers and parser using scripts in 'scripts' folder.

If you want to only build pyconcept:

- Build CCL-Full.sln in Release mode.
- Make sure you have Python installed and executable path is present in environment variables.
- Run pyconcept\script\Build.ps1. Answer 'A' if execution policy prompts for input
- pyconcept wheel will be deposited in output\py folder

## üíù Acknowledgements

This project is based on multiple projects and works listed below. If you notice any problems with licensing or missing acknowledgements please inform repository maintainer.

- [Re-flex](https://github.com/Genivia/RE-flex) provides clear way to generate lexical analyzers for ASCII and Unicode syntax variations
- [Bison](https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/) is used to generate language parser
- [nlohmann-json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json) is embedded as C++ JSON parser for conceptual schema persistence and high level JSON strings API
- [Clang-tidy](https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/) along with Visual Studio analyzer are used for C++ static code analysis
- [pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11) is used to generate Python module wrapper for C++ integration
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/) provides C++ projects build toolchain
- [conan](https://conan.io/) and NuGet are used to manage package dependencies
- Docker container is used to provide consistent build environment for Linux builds
- Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 and Visual Studio Code are used as IDE's and build environments for Windows builds
